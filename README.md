# GoBoxer

GoBoxer is a tool I started writing to learn about Websockets, and ended up getting out of hand. It's still far from complete, but can be used for managing Red Team infrastructure and projects, and can help with the following things:

- VPS creation across several Cloud providers.
- Domain name purchasing from various providers.
- Server provisioning using Ansible to execute tasks on infrastructure.
- Domain fronting/redirection using Cloudfront in AWS.
- Project/infrastructure allocation and management.

It's far from complete and there are bugs, but it's currently in a workable state.
